  <h3> Ronnel James Mira 
    <p>
      Hello, I'm Ronnel James Mira, originally from Quezon City but currently residing in Dumaguete City. By profession, I am an HVAC technician with a passion for ensuring comfortable environments in various settings. When I'm not busy with HVAC work, you can often find me behind the drum set, indulging in my love for progressive metal music. Music has always been a significant part of my life, providing both solace and excitement. <br>

      Aside from music, I have a deep love for culinary arts. Cooking allows me to express creativity and bring joy to others through delicious meals. I'm happily married and blessed with a wonderful teenager son who constantly inspires me to be the best version of myself. <br>

      I also have a love for adventure, particularly underwater diving. Exploring the depths of the ocean is a thrilling experience that never fails to amaze me. On land, I'm a professional driver, navigating the roads with skill and caution.<br>

      In my spare time, I enjoy dabbling in video editing and vlogging. Capturing moments and sharing stories through multimedia platforms is something I find immensely gratifying.<br>

      Overall, I'm someone who embraces life's opportunities with enthusiasm and strives to make a positive impact wherever I go.<br>
